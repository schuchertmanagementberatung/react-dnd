## FAQ

### _What do I need to get started?_

- node (https://nodejs.org)
- yarn (npm i -g yarn)

### _Why does `yarn version check` fail?_

This project uses Yarn's [deferred release workflow](https://yarnpkg.com/features/release-workflow). Each PR should contain a SemVer impact document, which can be created using `yarn version check --interactive`.
