This is the same dustbin example, but nested in an iframe.

When you are using the [react-dnd-html5-backend](/docs/backends/html5), you are limited to
drag-and-drop within a single HTML document.

Using react-dnd inside of an iframe requires using a [DndProvider](/docs/api/dnd-provider) within the iframe.
