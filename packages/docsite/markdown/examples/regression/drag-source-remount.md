title: 'Drag Source Remounts with Correct Props'
---

Regression example based on [#1429](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/pull/1429) that verifies that as drag-sources are remounted, they receive their correct props from React-DnD.

The box at the drag-source location should flash red while the item is being dragged around.
