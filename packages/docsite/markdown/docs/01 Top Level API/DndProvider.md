# DndProvider

The DndProvider component provides React-DnD capabilities to your application. This must be
injected with a backend via the `backend` prop, but it may be injected with a `window` object.

### Usage

```jsx
import { HTML5Backend } from 'react-dnd-html5-backend'
import { DndProvider } from 'react-dnd'

export default class YourApp {
  render() {
    return (
      <DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>
        /* Your Drag-and-Drop Application */
      </DndProvider>
    )
  }
}
```

### Props

- **`backend`**: Required. A React DnD backend. Unless you're writing a custom one, you probably want to use the [HTML5 backend](/docs/backends/html5) that ships with React DnD.
- **`context`**: Optional. The backend context used to configure the backend. This is dependent on the backend implementation.
- **`options`**: Optional. An options object used to configure the backend. This is dependent on the backend implementation.
